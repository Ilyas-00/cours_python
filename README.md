# Python Course Notes

This repository contains Python course notes covering fundamental and advanced language concepts. Here are some key examples:

## Data Types

- Basic data types include integers (`int`) and floating-point numbers (`float`).
- Mathematical operations, such as division (`/`) and exponentiation (`**`).
- Use of the modulo operator (`%`) to obtain the remainder of a division.

## Variables

- Creating variables to store values.
- Using the assignment operator (`=`) to assign a value to a variable.
- Displaying values using the `print()` function.

## Strings

- Manipulating strings with single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.
- Utilizing methods to convert text to uppercase or lowercase.
- String splitting (`split()`) into lists.

## Lists

- Creating lists to store collections of elements.
- Accessing list elements by their index.
- Using methods like `append()` to modify lists.

## Dictionaries

- Using dictionaries to store key-value pairs.
- Accessing values based on specific keys.

## Control Structures

- Employing conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to make decisions.
- Using `for` and `while` loops to iterate over sequences or execute code as long as a condition is true.

## Functions

- Creating functions to encapsulate reusable code.
- Using the `return` statement to return values from functions.
